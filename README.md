* Data Science Masters student at Cunef, Madrid.

I love statistics, ML, DL, and everything that has to do with prediction. But I also like cleaning and parsing data.

The main languages and tools I know and use are:

- Python ✨
- R ✨
- Git
- Bash
- Docker
- SQL

I also like using the command line, mainly Bash.

Some of the fields I have knowledge in are:

- Machine Learning: both supervised and unsupervised learning
- Statistics
- Data Analysis in general
- Data wrangling & cleanning
- Dimensionality reduction
- Financial analysis and Economics

And, beyond the endless list of stuff I'm looking forward to learn or dive deeper are:

- More statistics
- Deep Learning
- Reinforcment Learning
- Software in general, automating and writing more efficient code
